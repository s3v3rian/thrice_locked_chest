Basic Read/Write - Standard I/O
Read and Write functions allow reading and writing audio data from devices. These functions can be working in non blocking or blocking mode.
1. Non blocking means that if data is unavailable then we return with error code immediately.
2. Blocking moeans that if data is unavailable then we are blocked until the ring buffer has data (playback) or new data is available (capture).

Using standard I/O we can access data using interleaved or non interleaved access.
