====== PCM ======

Explanation

Capture value - Recorded via ADC.
Playback value - Is the de facto volume at a specific time.

Note - The quality of digital signal depends on the time (recording state) and voltage resolution.

PCM Frame - Contains a sample or multiple samples (If contains one sample means mono, multiple means stereo).

PCM states are:

1. SND_PCM_STATE_OPEN - After calling snd_pcm_open().
2. SND_PCM_STATE_SETUP - New parameters are accepted and waiting for snd_pcm_prepare() function call.
3. SND_PCM_STATE_PREPARED - Device is prepared.
4. SND_PCM_STATE_RUNNING
5. SND_PCM_STATE_XRUN - Device is in overrun or underrun state. Should use snd_pcm_recover() to recover from this state.
6. SND_PCM_STATE_DRAINING
7. SND_PCM_STATE_PAUSED
8. SND_PCM_STATE_SUSPENDED
9. SND_PCM_STATE_DISCONNECTED
