====== Memory Ordering ======
Created Saturday 03 October 2020

Interesting article - http://gcc.gnu.org/wiiki/Atomic/GCCMM/AtomicSync

Atomic variables are primarily used for syncing shared memory access between threads.
To support an atomic operation we need the following:
1. Store.
2. Load.
3. Memory Model.
For example if an atomic class supports an atomic operation on an int64_t type then there is a Load and Store operation for this type.

Memory Models.
1. Seq Consistent - Default.
2. Relaxed.
3. Acquire/Release.
4. Consume.

__Seq Consistent__
